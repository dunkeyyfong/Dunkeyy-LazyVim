# ðŸ’¤ DunkeyyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

This is my setup LazyVim with neosolarized-dark of [craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog)
(Because I am fan of Craftzdog, so I'm have setup colorscheme, keymaps of Craftzdog)

## Keymaps

You can setup keymaps in `lua/config/keymaps.lua`.

- You can edit colorscheme in `lua/config/colorscheme.lua` and edit `init.lua`

## Why?

Why I use LazyVim?

- Because LazyVim can be helped you update plugins, automatic download Plugins and Treesitter for language code what you're coding.
- You are not setup all plugins manage for neovim, no need code all things such as create `keymaps`, `colorscheme`, `init.lua`,...
